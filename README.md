# BaselStat - An Open Data Search Engine
 
Nowadays, an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Unfortunately, this data is mostly available on different sources and stored in different file formats.
 
 
We would like to create our own open data search engine with all available statistical data from the Kanton Basel Stadt.
Thus, the exploration of these records should become easy and intuitive, as if one would be googeling any topic.
 
 
The public API would allow other developers to create their own applications. Of course our frontend also retrieves its data from the public API.
 
 
Additionally to our Web Application we would like to create a visualisation by using the Microsoft HoloLens.
